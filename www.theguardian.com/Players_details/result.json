He’ll once again be used as a backup option, but is more than capable if needed. He raised eyebrows in the squad in April when he gave an interview about how footballers earn too much money. “When I see how hard construction workers or nurses have to work to earn a salary where they can barely make ends meet, then I have to say of course, we footballers earn too much. We’re not doing anything essential. Our sport is increasingly divorcing itself from normal society.” He also revealed in April he had considered quitting football after being caught up in the bomb attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus in 2017. “ I know we’re exposed to greater risk, and I wondered whether it made sense to keep taking this risk again and again. But nothing is 100% safe, and so I decided not to give up something which is so much fun.”",

He has suffered heavy criticism for past mistakes, and in 2012 a hashtag #TodoEsCulpaDeLayun (“Everything is Layún’s fault”) ridiculed him online. But he joined in on the joke - tweeting after he got a puncture on his car: “All my fault”. He even ended up making some money out of the catchphrase. In 2013 he scored to win the league title for Club América and the next year helped them retain the title as captain. He can play right or left-back, and even as a winger. He was the first Mexican to play in Italy, for Atalanta, although he didn’t stay long. He left Club América and joined Watford, who he helped win promotion in 2015. On swapping Mexico City for life in the Championship he said: “I love challenges. I am not a comfortable guy, I don’t like that life.” His stint was short-lived, though: in August that year he joined Porto - and spent the end of this season on loan at Sevilla.",

It has been quite a ride and he will hope this summer banishes bad memories of the 2014 World Cup, when he embarrassingly fumbled Lee Keun-ho’s harmless shot into his own net against South Korea. His reputation outside Russia tends to centre on an unwanted record of 43 Champions League games without a clean sheet, which only ended last November when CSKA Moscow beat Benfica 2-0. All of this ignores his enduring quality, though. Akinfeev is stable, confident and frequently saves whole games for CSKA Moscow. If his European record is questionable, he has kept more clean sheets in Russian football than any other goalkeeper. Akinfeev also has a peculiar taste in music – he recorded a couple of songs with the Russian pop group Ruki Vverkh! (“Hands up!”). ",

He’s a surprise pick for the final 23, but Lee has impressed at youth level for South Korea, and his senior breakthrough was only a matter of time. At the age of 12 he was taken on by Barcelona, working his way through the youth system before moving to Italy with Hellas Verona for €1.5m last year, with Barça retaining a buy-back clause. He made news in May by standing up to reported racist remarks from an Italian TV commentator who accused him of eating \"dog rolls\". Lee was quoted as saying: “It was a sneaky, vulgar attack motivated not by my football, but by my belonging to a specific ethnic group. It’s extremely denigrating and humiliating to me and to those in my native country.”",

Over the years he has become less anxious on the pitch and more cold-blooded, scoring more than 60 goals for Celta Vigo in the last three seasons. There’s no forward in Spain as capable of solving the problems that arise during a match, and his command of time and space, along with his exquisite left foot, allow him to adapt to play as a winger, a second forward or a centre-forward.
