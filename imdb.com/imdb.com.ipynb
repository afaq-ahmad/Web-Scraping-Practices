At times we see real men get hurt or killed. But much of the violence is perpetuated in dream worlds, where the people we see are not real, but manifestations of the subject\\'s subconscious. As a result, the \"real\" body count is surprisingly low (at least for a film that wields this much intensity), while metaphysical fatalities run off the chart. \\nMerging both categories, people are punched, kicked, choked, shot (scores of times), stabbed, hit by cars (several times), blown up, attacked by rampaging mobs, almost buried by avalanches and nearly drowned. Somebody gets shot in the footjust to illustrate that, while dying in a dream state is difficult, pain is all too easy to come by. \\nThe visceral feel of the violence is about what you\\'d expect for a PG-13 movie and, frankly, maybe a step back from a prime-time actioner on television. The mayhem is practically bloodless, and it\\'s perpetrated with a certain, almost chilly, remove. \\nWhen someone wants to exit a dream, they simply \"kill\" themselves or have someone do it for them. Cobb, for instance, shoots one of his compadres in the head to wake him up.

The scene features little nudity other than the man\\'s butt with the rest being under the sheets. Scene lasts for only a few seconds. \\nThere are two scenes where a man sits at a bar in a strip club. There are one or two topless women, wearing tassels on their nipples, behind him. The topless women are in the background, out of focus, and hard to see. \\nTonya\\'s mother comes along on their first date, asking vulgarly if they\\'ve had sex yet. \\nThey hadn\\'t at that point, but it was only a matter of time. \\nThey wind up living together before they tie the knot, and we see them make out frantically, as well as tumbling onto beds and floors to have sex (we see Jeff\\'s exposed backside). \\nThey kiss frequently. Eventually, Tonya divorces Jeff, but they continue to work closely together. \\nWe don\\'t see any explicit nudity between Tonya and Jeff, but a scene does take place in a strip club, and we see topless dancers wearing tassels working in the background. \\nWhen Tonya is a teen, we see her in a bra. \\nHer brother grabs her (clothed) breast at one point. \\nTonya skates to ZZ Top\\'s suggestive song \"Sleeping Bag.\" \\nSkaters, naturally, wear form-fitting outfits for competition. \\nWe learn that LaVona now lives behind a porn shop.', u'0', u'3', u'16', u'3', u'There are two instances where two separate characters shoot a gun at another person. One instance is a total miss; the other results in the target falling to the ground, the bullet just grazing their face. Blood is seen dripping down, although the injury is minor. \\nThere are multiple scenes of domestic violence. Some are moderate, others are quite shocking. It ranges from a mother beating her child in a bathroom with a hairbrush (not gory), to multiple scenes where a man punches a woman\\'s face, drawing blood. There is also a frightening scene where a knife is mistakenly thrown at someone in anger, hitting their arm and drawing some blood. \\nA woman gets hit on the knees by a man with a baton. The man runs away while the woman screams. The hit itself is not shown in frame. \\nTwo characters are shown hunting rabbits, played off as family time. The hits are not shown, although one character is shown skinning the dead rabbits (graphic) and laying the fur out on a sawhorse. It is shown later that the rabbit fur was made into a coat. \\nThere is a boxing scene shot up close. The boxers are shown getting punched, and as the scene progresses, faces begin to swell from injury. As a woman is punched in the mouth, her mouthguard flies off with some blood, in slow-motion. \\nBlood is seen dripping from a character\\'s mouth onto the floor. She then gets up, the camera staying on the puddle of blood. \\nIn one scene, when Tonya and Jeff have an altercation, Tonya chases Jeff away with a gun. No one gets hurt. \\nThe attack on Nancy\\'s knee is pretty brief and bloodless. \\nWe see a guy whip out the baton and land the blow. \\nWhile trying to get away, the assailant finds the door to the outside is locked and, in desperation, breaks the door\\'s glass with his head. \\nHe knocks over a guy as he flees. \\nAnd then there\\'s the abuse that LaVona, Jeff and Tonya inflict upon each other. \\nWhen Tonya is just a little girl, LaVona beats her with a brush. \\nShe kicks over a chair Tonya\\'s sitting in. \\nWhen Tonya\\'s older, the two fight, and one winds up stabbing the other in the arm with a knife \\nWe see blood on both the arm and the table \\nLaVona pays someone to heckle her, too \\n\"The thing about Tonya, she would skate better when she was enraged,\" her mom says by way of excuse. \\nWhen Tonya moves in with Jeff, she suggests that she exchanged one abusive relationship for another. \\nWe see Jeff slap and punch Tonya in the face and slam her against walls. \\nShe later gets a restraining order against him. Her face is sometimes bloody and bruised. \\nTonya slaps Jeff, too, and at one point tells him that he should just kill himself. \\nShe also shoots at him with a shotgun. \\n\"I never did this,\" Tonya says as she ejects a casing from the weapon \\nIndeed, the movie suggests that neither Tonya nor Jeff are necessarily reliable narrators \\nJeff characterizes himself as a \"pretty meek guy\" who\\'d never hurt anyone. \\nMeanwhile, Tonya is, in her mind, always the victim. \\nThe film simply documents the chaos from each of their points of view. \\nAs a child, Tonya and her father shoot and skin rabbits (we don\\'t see the bullet hit, but we do see a carcass dressed), and her father makes her a fur coat out of the pelts. \\nTonya throws skates at her coach \\nShe pushes past other skaters \\nAfter her skating career is over, Tonya takes up boxing \\nWe see her getting beaten savagely and knocked down, spitting blood out on the ring floor before getting back up again.', u'0', u'0', u'4', u'24', u'There is frequent usage of the expletive \\'f***\\' and \\'s***\\' throughout the film, coupled with occasional use of other expletives such as \\'c**t\\', \\'d**k\\' and \\'c***sucker\\'. \\nVery strong language is present in the film. The f-word is said about 120 times, coupled with an approximately equal amount of \\'sh*t\\', and 3 uses of \\'c*nt* \\nLaVona Harding tells Diane to \"lick her ass\" in a offensive manner. \\nTonya tells a judge to \"suck her dick\". \\nThe most offensive, but comedic, profane moment is when LaVonna says to another mother, \"I didn\\'t swear, you c**t.\" \\n130 f-words, 25 s-words and three uses of the c-word. We also hear \"a--,\" \"b--ch,\" \"d--n\" and \"h---,\" along with seven misuses of God\\'s name (three with \"d--n\") and five abuses of Jesus\\' name. We also see a couple of crass hand gestures. \\nWe also hear \"a--,\" \"b--ch,\" \"d--n\" and \"h---,\" along with seven misuses of God\\'s name (three with \"d--n\") and five abuses of Jesus\\' name. \\nWe also see a couple of crass hand gestures. \\nThere\\'s a crude verbal reference to the male anatomy. \\nA guy from a television tabloid opines that the two people who actually perpetrated the attack on Nancy were the \"two biggest boobs in a story populated solely by boobs.\"', u'0', u'3', u'15', u'1', u\"Major characters are shown smoking frequently on camera, especially during the interview scenes. \\nA skating coach berates a mother for smoking on the ice, while the mother ignores her. A skater is shown smoking before a competition and after practice. She is also shown using an inhaler. \\nThere are several scenes where characters drink alcohol, although no one is shown drunk. \\nTonya and most of the folks in her circle smoke cigarettes. \\nWe see her at one point stop smoking right before going on the ice and snuffing the butt out with her skate blade. \\nShe drinks beer, too; a few scenes take place in bars \\nIn a flashback, we see Tonya and Nancy in a hotel room together, shotgunning beers. \\nJeff's car is pulled over when he's drunk and the car contains alcohol (and a couple of guns besides.)\", u'0', u'5', u'13', u'3', u\"Two characters get into an argument where objects get thrown thoughtlessly. The last of these objects is a steak knife, which hits a character in the arm. It sticks out of her arm until she pulls it out. There is some blood on her sleeve and on the tip of the knife. There is a drawn-out moment where the audience isn't sure the victim will retaliate, but she simply puts the knife back down on the table and walks away. \\nA man pushes his way into a room and points a gun at a woman, threatening to kill her. He then points the gun at his own head several times, threatening to kill himself. The woman attempts to calm the man down, getting close enough to attack him, escapes the room, and gets outside. The man attempts to shoot the gun at her. The bullet richochets off of his car into pieces of schrapnel and hits the girl abover her eye, causing her to fall to the ground, but ultimately sustains a minor injury as the bullet only grazed her face. The man then points the gun at several onlookers. \\nThere are many scenes of a male controlling and manipulating his female intimate partner with violence or the threat of violence, such as punching her in the face, smashing her face against a mirror, banging her head against a car window, forcing his way into her residence by kicking down a locked door, threatening to kill her, and gaslighting her with false accusations and profanity. In one instance he follows through on his death threats, by shooting her in the street as she is fleeing from him. These attacks leave her visibly bruised and bloodied, psychologically confused and blaming herself for the abuse.\"]\n",

One man is an alcoholic. \\nA woman is revealed to have an addiction to Barbital.

Graphic, could upset viewers. \\nThe characters are shown to be in peril, given their passenger car is trapped in the snow on a bridge. \\nA man orders a group of characters to kill him and then throw his body into the lake. They hesitate, and a one of them initially points the revolver at him, then threatens to kill herself. \\nIn a flashback, a woman is wrongly sentenced for the murder of a child (that she did not commit), she is revealed later to have committed suicide.']\n",

This is played for comedic effect. \\nThere is a brief shot of an outdoor party where bare male and female backsides can be seen briefly. \\nLucy often waits for Barry to get home to have sex with him. \\nShe greets him in skimpy negligee once. \\nSeveral scenes picture them having sex (including one quick-cut montage that shows them making love in three different places). \\nOne sex scene takes place while Barry is flying. \\nMovements and noises are explicit in each of these scenes, though nudity is strategically avoided. \\nWe also see Barry in bed, shirtless, with his wife lying next to him. \\nLucy wears revealing outfits, and we see her in a bikini. \\nBarry likes to moon his family as a joke, and we see his bare rear a couple of times. \\nLucy grabs his (clothed) backside once. \\nOne of Barry\\'s fellow TWA coworkers says that when women in hotels see a man in a pilot\\'s uniform, their \"panties come off.\" \\nBarry gives pornographic magazines to men in a rough part of Central America to keep them from beating him up and stealing his clothes.', u'1', u'11', u'2', u'0', u\"Violence is mostly implied rather than shown visually throughout the film. \\nAll the action scenes in the film are of a non-violent nature. \\nBarry knows no fear behind the stick of his plane. \\nBut things get hairy more than once. \\nHe tears through the upper canopies of trees in Columbia, barely making it above the forest on takeoff because his plane is so loaded down with coke. \\nIn another scene, he zooms into a residential neighborhood to land (trying to avoid DEA agents), and his plane's wings get shredded before what's left of the vehicle comes to a halt in someone's front yard. \\nBarry is repeatedly shot at by military forces of the governments he's spying upon. \\nAt one point, an engine gets hit and explodes, but Barry just laughs. \\nHe also gets beat up badly (mostly offscreen) in Columbia. \\nWe later see that he's lost a tooth, and his face is bloodied as well. \\nA man is killed when a bomb unexpectedly blows up his car. \\nThe government eventually compels Barry to film the Columbian drug dealers he's been working with (in order to avoid prison). \\nWhen those men discover they've been betrayed, they send assassins to kill Barry. \\nWe see only two men approaching either side of a car that Barry's sitting in, and we hear that he's been murdered.\", u'0', u'0', u'9', u'7', u'Very strong language (\"c**t\") is voiced once, as well as more frequent strong language such as \"motherf**ker\" and \"f**k\". \\nMore than 25 s-words. \\nAbout 60 f-words, including at least five combined with \"mother.\" \\nGod\\'s name is taken in vain at least 15 times, about half of those uses paired with \"d--n.\" Jesus\\' name is taken in vain once. \\nWe hear about 10 instances of \"h---,\" and four of \"d--n.\" \\nOther vulgarities include one use of the c-word, and one or two utterances each of \"b--ch,\" \"a--,\" \"a--hole,\" \"p-ss,\" \"p--sies\" and \"pr--k.\"', u'0', u'2', u'7', u'3', u'Although this film focuses on drugs, little drug use is shown on-screen. However, there are several verbal drug references throughout the film, mostly for ironic effect. \\nVisual drug references (e.g. cocaine) are also present. \\nBarry smuggles cocaine for the Columbian cartel on a massive level, transporting so much of the illegal drug that he hires four other pilots to fly missions with him. \\nWe learn that Barry shipped billions of dollars of the stuff singlehandedly. \\nAccordingly, we see myriad plastic wrapped bricks of coke. \\nBarry devises a way to drop them from the bottom of his plane, and we see him \"bombing\" recipients who wait in Louisiana\\'s swamps to collect the narcotic parcels. \\nWhen Barry crawls out of his plane after that rough residential landing, he\\'s covered with the cocaine that\\'s accidentally erupted in the process. \\nWe also see an older woman with many kilos of cocaine taped to her body after she\\'s arrested. \\nVarious characters smoke cigarettes and drink different kinds of alcohol throughout the film. \\nWe see boxes of the illegal Cuban cigars Barry is smuggling.', u'2', u'7', u'2', u'0', '']\n",

The violence is more stylized than graphic. Almost no blood is seen. However, a great deal of medievalweapons are visible during this scene, and corpses are strewn all over. During a one-on-one fight between theleader of the men and the dark lord, the man is flung against rocks and dies. Another man then uses the sword ofthe fallen leader to cut off Sauron's fingers, and remove the ring. Sauron then disintegrates into a pile of ashes andsends a shock wave across the field obliterating the rest of both armies. The scene in which Sauron's fingers are cutoff is shown a few more times during the course of the three films. \\nThis flashback culminates with a scene in which a man dives into a river and then is shot by archers. We do not see the impact, but the man is seen floating dead with several arrows protruding from his back, and some diluted blood can be seen in the water. \\nTwo elderly men fight using long sticks that emit bolts of power. They are both knocked to the ground, and flung about. By the end, they both have bloody faces. One is magically forced to rotate while lying on the floor, with his fixed head being the central point of rotation. \\nAn innocent hobbit strolling down a street has his head lopped off by a Nazgul, (non-graphic). The scene cuts away on impact. \\nOne of the main characters is stabbed in the shoulder by one of the Nazgul. He screams. We see him later, near death, with a bloody wound. \\nThere is a battle in a cavern involving the heroes, orcs, and a troll. This battle is mostly non-graphic swordplay with the exception of two points. The first is when a man removes the head of an orc, and there is a small splash of black blood. The second is when the troll is shot through the mouth; again, there is little to no blood, but the arrows are shown protruding from the back of the creature's head, and from its mouth. \\nA man is repeatedly shot with arrows. We see the impact, and he grunts in pain. He is shot three times in total. An uruk then prepares to shoot him in the head, but he is interrupted by another character. \\nThe second graphic scene depicts a duel between a main character and the creature which had been about to kill the first man. This is the most violent scene in the film, and lasts approximately one minute. Despite the short duration, there is a good deal of realistic blood. The creature then runs at him, intending to kill him, but he slips away and stabs the creature in the thigh with a knife. The creature picks him up and headbutts him several times, before tossing him aside, and removes the knife from its thigh. The man is seen watching, with blood on his face and clearly in his mouth, as the creature licks the blood off the blade, and then throws the knife at the him. The battle ends abruptly when the man chops the creature's arm off, and then runs it through. The creature growls, and impales itself further. The man then withdraws the sword and beheads the creature. A small amount of black blood is seen flying through the air, and there is blood on the sword's blade.\", u'13', u'1', u'0', u'0', u'No swearing. A few imaginative insults.', u'1', u'10', u'2', u'0', u'The Hobbits drink a lot of ale, and some get drunk. \\nOne scene at a bar where seveal people are drinking alcohol. Several people there are very drunk. \\nA lot of characters smoke pipes. \\nGandalf and Bilbo are seen smoking cigars. \\nWhen Frodo and friends go to a bar to hide from Nazgul the people that are inside are seen drinking a lot and some are getting drunk.', u'0', u'0', u'14', u'0', u\"Gandalf leans over to pick up the ring and a very sudden flash of the eye with a loud noise happens. May startle many. \\nThere are a couple of jump moments. A scene in which a friendly character's face briefly turns grotesque suddenly and without warning. The change is accompanied by a loud snarl from the character, but he returns back to how he was crying. \\nAnother jump scene involves a character hiding behind a pillar, when suddenly, a much larger creature goes around the other side of the pillar and roars loudly. \\nMany people (especially younger viewers), will find the scenes with the Nazgul frightening and intense. They are evil creatures that are cloaked all in black, and that give off a bloodcurdling cry from time to time. \\nThe formation of Lurtz is grotesque. Some may find it disturbing. \\nThe facial appearance of the Orcs could be scary. The faces of the orcs are cut up and a little bloody with yellow eyes and gray skin. \\nMost of the battle sequences are intense. There is one scene with a gigantic, flaming, demon-like creature, called a Balrog. \\nAn enormous squid-like creature with numerous tentacles and razor sharp teeth attacks the Fellowship. \\nThere is one brief scene in which a creature is tortured. This may be disturbing for younger viewers. The creature's screams can be heard and his hands are visible, but nothing graphic is shown. \\nWhen a man is affected by the ring, he becomes irrational and gets somewhat scary, shouting and grabbing other characters.\"]\n",
