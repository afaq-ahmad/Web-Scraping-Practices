      "42 mins\n",
      "This is a fiery end-to-end encounter so far, and very much living up to the billing. Granqvist cuts off Lozano as Gallardo blasts a square ball across the face of the Swedish goal and injures himself in the process, though his side are able to recover possession and whip it away.\n",
