Both sides looked liable to drop off in the first half-hour before Denis Cheryshev scored for the hosts with one of the best goals of the tournament - and after that, it was all guns blazing as Andrej Kramaric headed home a leveller two minutes later. For the first time in the last eight, it's level pegging at the interval; are we headed for extra-time and penalties at Fisht Olympic Stadium? At half-time, it's Russia 1-1 Croatia. \n",
      "nonmatch  It's arguably been Russia's best half of football since their demolition of Saudi Arabia in their opening game but Stanislav Cherchesov will have been less than impressed to concede so cheaply. For him, it will be a case of shoring up his defence in the second half, much as he did against Spain. For Croatia, they look marginally better than they did against Denmark, in one of the World Cup's more dismal ties so far - but still far off the pace of the side who dismantled Argentina. Zlatko Dalic needs more pace; will he make an early change? \n",
